# LunaCore

**Visual GUI wrapper (dashboard) for the Claude Code CLI.**

LunaCore wraps the real `claude` CLI in an Electron window: a live terminal in the
center, clickable action buttons on the left, and a status monitor on the right.
It adds control and visibility **without spending a single extra token** — it never
injects prompts or touches the `claude` binary.

> Status: **Phases 1–4 + full backlog implemented** — interactive terminal,
> Action Injector, live Passive Observer, runtime profile switching, localhost
> ports tracker, action cheat-sheets, skill cheat-sheet, a multi-line
> **prompt library**, a **working/waiting LED**, a local **scratchpad**, a
> **command palette (Ctrl+K)**, a **token burn-rate sparkline**, a swappable
> **theming system**, a **PL/EN language switch**, a live **usage-limits gauge**
> (5-hour + weekly subscription windows), an **armed auto-compact** toggle, a
> **CWD/project switcher**, and a **cyberpunk boot sequence**.

## ⚠️ Core constraint: zero extra tokens

LunaCore **must not** inject hidden system prompts, middleware, or modify the
`claude` binary. Any "smart" context analysis by an extra agent would burn the
user's context window. It works only as:

- **Passive Observer** — listens to the CLI's `stdout` stream and extracts data via
  regex on the Node.js backend (no round-trips to any model).
- **Action Injector** — GUI buttons write plain text directly to the PTY `stdin`,
  exactly as if the user typed it.

**Data flow:**

| Direction | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Passive Observer (terminal) | `ptyProcess.onData` → IPC `pty:data` → `xterm.write()` |
| Passive Observer (Skill Tracker) | `ptyProcess.onData` → `detectTools()` (ANSI strip + regex) → IPC `metrics:tools` → tiles light up |
| Passive Observer (Context %) | `TranscriptWatcher` tails `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` → real `usage` tokens → IPC `metrics:context` → bar |
| Action Injector (keyboard) | `xterm.onData` → IPC `pty:write` → `ptyProcess.write()` |
| Action Injector (button) | `runCommand('/compact')` → IPC `pty:command` → writes `/compact\r` |
| Action Injector (prompt) | `pastePrompt(text, submit)` → IPC `pty:paste` → writes `ESC[200~ text ESC[201~` (bracketed paste), then `\r` only if `submit` |
| Action Injector (palette) | Ctrl+K overlay aggregates actions/cheat-sheets/prompts/skills → fires the **existing** injector for the chosen row (no new PTY channel) |
| Passive Observer (sparkline) | second `metrics:context` listener buffers the same `usage` samples → SVG sparkline + tok/min + ETA to 85% |
| Passive Observer (usage gauge) | `UsageWatcher` reads the CLI's OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` → **GET** `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` → IPC `usage:update` → 5h + weekly bars (read-only, never `/v1/messages`) |
| Prefs (theme/language/boot) | `getThemes()`/`getUiPrefs()`/`setUiPrefs()` → IPC `themes:list` / `ui:get` / `ui:set` → reads `config/themes.json`, persists `config/ui.local.json`; renderer writes CSS tokens + xterm palette live |
| Boot sequence | renderer-only overlay: CSS drives every pixel of motion, JS only stamps `animation-delay` on the log rows and removes the node. No IPC, no PTY, no tokens |

The Context Window % divides live `usage` tokens by a `CONTEXT_LIMIT` constant
(200k default, in [`src/observer.js`](src/observer.js) — raise it for 1M-context
sessions).

Security: the renderer has **no** direct Node.js access. All IPC goes through a
`contextBridge` preload (`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`).

## Tech stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Desktop framework | Electron |
| Terminal core | [`@lydell/node-pty`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lydell/node-pty) + [`@xterm/xterm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xterm/xterm) + `@xterm/addon-fit` |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS (swappable themes via CSS custom properties, PL/EN i18n) |

> **Why `@lydell/node-pty` instead of `node-pty`?** It ships prebuilt N-API
> binaries, so it installs **without** node-gyp / Visual Studio Build Tools — one
> binary works across Node and Electron versions. The original `node-pty` requires
> a working C++ toolchain and fails to detect very new Visual Studio releases.

---

## Getting started

Requirements: **Node.js 18+** (tested on 24) and **Git**. No C++ build tools needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kotsur69/Luna-Core-HUD.git
cd Luna-Core-HUD
npm install
npm start
```

On launch, LunaCore spawns your default shell (`powershell.exe` on Windows,
`$SHELL` elsewhere) and auto-runs `claude` (the active profile's `command`).
Make sure the Claude Code CLI is installed. If it was installed to
`~/.local/bin` (the native-installer default) and that directory isn't on your
`PATH`, LunaCore prepends it to the session `PATH` automatically — so `claude`,
the profile auto-start, and the cheat-sheet buttons all resolve without you
having to fix `PATH` by hand.

To start in a bare shell instead of auto-launching `claude`, pick the
**Sama powloka (bez claude)** profile in the left panel, or set the active
profile's `command` to `""` in [`config/profiles.json`](config/profiles.json).

| + | Cyberpunk boot sequence + global reduced-motion support | ✅ done |

That closes the whole approved shortlist. **Next up** (see
[`FUTURE_PLAN.md`](FUTURE_PLAN.md) §8): split the ~1370-line `renderer.js` into
modules and introduce a widget contract — the structural work that unblocks
layout presets, movable panels and everything after them. §9 sketches the bigger
open question: turning LunaCore into a multi-model console (Claude / Kimi /
local LM Studio) rather than a Claude-only HUD.

The right panel lights up live: the Context Window bar reflects real `usage`
tokens from the session transcript, and Skill Tracker tiles glow when Claude runs
the matching tool (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, Web, Task).

## Launch profiles

The left-panel switcher restarts the PTY session under a different profile,
defined in [`config/profiles.json`](config/profiles.json):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `command` | what to run in the shell (`claude`, or empty for a bare shell) |
| `args` | extra CLI arguments appended to the command |
| `env` | environment overrides for the session (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for a local LM Studio endpoint) |

Ship-safe defaults: **Claude Cloud**, **LM Studio (local)**, **bare shell**.
Drop a `config/profiles.local.json` (gitignored) to add or override profiles
by `id` without touching the committed file — handy for machine-specific keys.
Switching a profile kills the current session and starts a fresh one with the
selected environment; no extra tokens are spent.

## Localhost ports tracker

The right panel lists listening TCP ports (dev servers and everything else),
scanned every few seconds via `Get-NetTCPConnection` on Windows (`lsof` on
macOS/Linux), each mapped to its owning process and PID. Per row you can open
`http://localhost:PORT` in the browser, copy the URL, or kill the process (with
a confirm). Purely local, read-only observation — no tokens spent.

## Action cheat-sheets

Collapsible command groups in the left panel, defined in
[`config/cheatsheets.json`](config/cheatsheets.json). Each group is a `<details>`
section with a row of buttons; clicking one injects its command straight into the
session via the Action Injector — one click, one command. Defaults cover "Review
before commit", Git, Claude session, and test/build.

Convention: a command prefixed with `!` runs as a **shell** command inside the
Claude session (e.g. `!git diff`), while an unprefixed command is typed verbatim
(slash commands like `/compact`, `/code-review`). Add a
`config/cheatsheets.local.json` (gitignored) to override groups by `title` or add
your own.

## Skill cheat-sheet

The left panel also auto-scans your Claude Code skill directories
(`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/plugins`) for `SKILL.md` files, reads each one's
`name`/`description` from frontmatter, and groups them into collapsible
categories (Frontend, Backend, Data/ML, DevOps, Tests, Security, Database,
Git/Review, Docs, Other). Click a category to expand its skills; click a skill
to copy its name. Categorisation is keyword-heuristic (rough by design) and the
scan result is cached per session. Read-only, zero tokens.

## Prompt library

Action cheat-sheets handle one-liners; the prompt library handles the **multi-line
prompts you retype constantly**. Groups live in
[`config/prompts.json`](config/prompts.json), each prompt being
`{ label, text, note }` where `text` is a string *or* an array of lines (easier to
read in JSON). Clicking a prompt **pastes it without sending**, so you can append
specifics before hitting Enter; the small `⏎` button pastes and sends immediately.

Injection uses **bracketed paste mode** (`ESC[200~ … ESC[201~`) rather than a raw
write. This matters: in the Claude TUI every newline is an Enter, so a raw
multi-line write would submit at the first line and scatter the rest across
several messages. Bracketed paste tells the terminal "this is a paste, not
keystrokes" — the whole block lands in the input buffer with its line breaks
intact and nothing is sent until you say so. Drop a `config/prompts.local.json`
(gitignored) for private prompts; it overrides base groups by `title`.

## Working/waiting LED

A small dot in the terminal bar: **amber and pulsing** while Claude works,
**steady green** once it's your turn, **red** when the session ends. It adds no
IPC and no new process — the signal was already in the stream you're rendering.
The TUI streams stdout continuously while it thinks and falls quiet when it wants
input, so *data = working* and *silence past 800 ms = waiting on you*. The
threshold sits deliberately above the spinner frame rate so the LED doesn't
strobe between states.

## Scratchpad

A notepad in the right panel for snippets, TODOs and fragments you want to keep
next to the session. It autosaves 500 ms after you stop typing to
`config/scratchpad.local.md` — a plain file (gitignored, 256 KB cap) rather than
`localStorage`, so you can open and grep it outside the app. **Wklej do sesji**
injects the notes through the same bracketed-paste channel as the prompt library,
without sending, so you can still add to them first.

## Command palette (Ctrl+K)

Press **Ctrl+K** (or the chip in the terminal bar) to open a fuzzy-search overlay
over everything injectable: the COMPACT action, every cheat-sheet command, every
prompt, and every scanned skill. Type to filter (subsequence match, matched
letters highlighted), `↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` to fire, `Esc` to close. Firing
routes to the **existing** injector for that row — a command types itself into the
session, a prompt pastes (⇧`Enter` pastes *and* sends), a skill copies its name.
Pure renderer overlay: no new PTY channel, no tokens.

## Token burn-rate sparkline

Under the Context Window bar, a small SVG sparkline plots context % over time so
you can *see* the trend, not just the current number — plus a **tok/min** burn
rate and an **ETA to 85%** (the compact zone). It piggybacks on the same `usage`
samples the bar already receives (a second `metrics:context` listener), so it adds
no polling and no tokens. The dashed line marks the 85% threshold.

## Usage-limits gauge

A right-panel tile showing how much of your Claude **subscription** limits you've
burned: the **5-hour** window and the **weekly** window (plus Opus/Sonnet weekly
splits when present), each as a bar with a percentage and a "resets in …"
countdown. This is the one piece of data that is genuinely **not** in the session
transcript or stdout, so it needs an authenticated source — but it stays
**zero-token** by design.

How it stays token-safe: `src/usage.js` reads the CLI's own OAuth access token
from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and makes a plain **GET** to
`api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` — the same read-only usage endpoint the
account uses, **never** `/v1/messages`. No prompt, no model round-trip, nothing
that spends tokens or context. LunaCore never writes to the credentials file; it
just reads the token fresh on each poll, so when the `claude` CLI refreshes and
rewrites that file, LunaCore rides the refresh for free. If the token is missing
or expired the tile shows a **reauth** hint ("run `claude` to refresh it"); a 90 s
poll plus a manual ↻ button keep it current, and a live 30 s tick updates the
reset countdown between polls. Set `ENABLE_USAGE_METER = false` at the top of
[`src/main.js`](src/main.js) to disable the network call entirely (tile shows
"off"). The bars animate via `transform: scaleX(var(--usage))` — no layout thrash.

## Theming

The whole look is a set of CSS custom-property tokens, so a "theme" is just a
values file. Ships with **cyberpunk** (default), **synthwave**, **matrix**,
**nord**, and **light**, defined in [`config/themes.json`](config/themes.json);
`src/theme.js` loads and validates them (falling back to a built-in cyberpunk if
the file is broken, same as `profiles.js`). Pick one from the **Appearance**
section in the left panel — it applies live, rewriting the CSS tokens on
`documentElement` *and* the xterm terminal palette, no reload. Each theme sets
both the UI vars (`--bg`, `--neon-magenta`, `--btn-grad`, `--glow`…) and the
terminal's ANSI colours. Drop a `config/themes.local.json` (gitignored) to add or
override themes by `id`.

## Language (PL / EN)

An **Appearance → Language** switch flips the whole UI between Polish and English
live. Static labels carry `data-i18n` / `data-i18n-ph` / `data-i18n-title`
attributes filled from [`src/renderer/i18n.js`](src/renderer/i18n.js); dynamic
strings (LED state, token counts, burn rate, palette rows) go through `t()`. Note
this translates **LunaCore's own chrome** only — the `claude` CLI output in the
terminal is whatever the CLI itself emits. Both the theme and language choice
persist to `config/ui.local.json` (gitignored) via `src/uiprefs.js`, so the app
reopens exactly how you left it.

## Boot sequence

A ~1.4-second themed overlay on launch: the wordmark resolves, a drifting grid
and a CRT scan sweep pass behind it, a five-line subsystem log fills in, and a
progress rule closes it out. Every colour comes from the theme tokens, so it
inherits all five themes for free, and the log is translated like the rest of the
chrome.

It is decoration, and it behaves like decoration. It **never blocks**: the PTY
launches and streams underneath while it plays, and a click or any keypress
dismisses it instantly. The keypress is deliberately not consumed — it travels on
to the terminal, so skipping the animation doesn't eat the first character you
type. All the motion is CSS (`transform`/`opacity` only, no layout thrash); the
renderer just stamps `animation-delay` on the log rows and removes the node.

Turn it off under **Appearance → Boot sequence**; the choice persists to
`ui.local.json` and applies from the next launch. If your OS asks for reduced
motion, it never runs at all.

> One deliberate oddity: a small **inline** `<script>` in `index.html` force-hides
> the overlay after 4 seconds. It's there because a renderer parse error would
> otherwise leave the overlay covering the entire HUD forever — that inline timer
> is the only code that survives such a crash. LunaCore has been bricked by
> exactly that class of bug before (an i18n global colliding with `renderer.js`).

## Reduced motion

LunaCore honours the system "reduce motion" setting. The boot sequence is skipped
entirely and the decorative pulses, blinks and glow alarms collapse to nothing.
The usage-refresh spinner is the one exemption — a loading indicator is the only
continuous motion worth keeping, because it's reporting real state.

Nothing is lost by turning motion off: every signal in the HUD carries its meaning
in **colour** — the working/waiting LED, the PTY dot, the context alarm — with
movement only ever as reinforcement.
